    Competitive 2-player MCTS for strategy optimization.
    
    Key design:
    - Tree search is driven entirely by node.active_player (not a global current_player).
    - Root is always P1's turn. Children alternate: depth 1 is P2, depth 2 is P1, etc.
    - Each non-root node stores one W/Q pair for the player who created that node
      (the active player of its parent). This makes UCT selection at a parent use
      child values from the parent's perspective.
